  "summary": "Diff adds a branch-fixed print location utility and uses it to enforce fixed addresses for \"bachupally\" and \"nezampat\" in localStorage load/save, Optimize Bill defaults saving (including backend persistence), and backend-to-local sync (skips syncing for fixed branches). However, the diff summary is truncated for OptimizeBillPage.tsx, so the requested UI behavior (non-editable input + English helper text) cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Update the Optimize Bill UI so that the Print Location Address input is not editable for branch users \"bachupally\" and \"nezampat\" and clearly indicates it is fixed for that branch (user-facing text must be in English).",
      "reason": "OptimizeBillPage.tsx is truncated before showing the Print Location Address input rendering/props. The diff shows state being set to the fixed value, but there is no visible evidence that the input is disabled/read-only or that English helper text is displayed for those users.",
