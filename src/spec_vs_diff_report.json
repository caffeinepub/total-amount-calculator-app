  "summary": "Diff implements hardcoded branch credentials with input normalization, adds an auth gate page, and gates App rendering based on branch auth state. However, the diff evidence is truncated and does not clearly show that BranchAuthProvider is actually mounted around the app, which is required for the gate/login state to function end-to-end.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Gate the app so the main website/app UI cannot be accessed until the hardcoded branch credentials are entered and the user is authenticated via branch login (do not allow Internet Identity login to bypass this gate).",
      "reason": "Although AppContent checks useBranchAuth().isAuthenticated and returns <AuthGatePage /> when false, the diff excerpt does not show BranchAuthProvider being mounted around AppContent (or at the app root in main.tsx). Without the provider, useBranchAuth will throw at runtime and the gating/login flow cannot work reliably.",
