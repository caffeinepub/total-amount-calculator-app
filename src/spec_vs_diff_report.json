The diff summary text asserts an in-page print flow using `window.print()` and a print-only wrapper for `PrintBill`, but the actual implementation details (no `?print=true` navigation/new tab, and preservation of bill-save/ledger/daily-summary side effects on print) are not directly visible in the provided code excerpt.",
