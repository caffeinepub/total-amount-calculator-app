# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the bill section from the balance sheet display while keeping all other sheet information intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the bill-related section from the balance sheet view
- Preserve daily totals display
- Preserve item quantities display
- Keep day selection and clear-all functionality working

**User-visible outcome:** The balance sheet will show daily totals and item quantities without displaying the bill section, providing a cleaner view of the data.
